2004-04-03   Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* Version 1.02 -- some bugfixes, lots of new docs and tests

	The classes Text::Shoebox::Lexicon and Text::Shoebox::Entry now
	have complete documentation!

	There's also now a whole bunch of tests in t/*.t
	And in writing those, I turned up some errors in the previous
	versions -- so don't use anything before 1.02!

	Also, some doc typoes fixed in Text::Shoebox.
	
	
2004-03-24   Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
	* Version 1.01 -- no basic changes to Text::Shoebox, but adding a
	new interface.

	* Added the classes Text::Shoebox::Lexicon and
	Text::Shoebox::Entry.  Their documentation is incomplete, but I
	should fix that VERY SOON.

	* Corrected a few niggling doc typoes in Text::Shoebox
