=head1 NAME

Text::Shoebox - read and write SIL Shoebox Standard Format (.sf) files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Text::Shoebox;
  my $lex = [];
  foreach my $file (@ARGV) {
    read_sf(
      from_file => $file, into => $lex,
    ) or warn "read from $file failed\n";
  }
  print scalar(@$lex), " entries read.\n";
  
  die "hw field-names differ\n"
   unless are_hw_keys_uniform($lex);
  warn "hw field-values aren't unique\n"
   unless are_hw_values_unique($lex);
  
  write_sf(from => $lex, to_file => "merged.sf")
   or die "Couldn't write to merged.sf: $!";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Summer Institute of Linguistics (C<http://www.sil.org/>) makes a
piece of free software called "the Linguist's Shoebox", or just
"Shoebox" for short.  It's a simple database program generally used
for making lexicon databases (altho it can also be used for databases
of field notes, etc.).

Shoebox can export its databases to SF (Standard Format) files, a
simple text format.  Reading and writing those SF files is what this
Perl module, Text::Shoebox, is for.  (I have heard that Standard Format
predates Shoebox quite a bit, and is used by other programs.  If you
use SF files with something other than Shoebox, I'd be interested in
hearing about it, particularly about whether such files and
Text::Shoebox are happily compatible.)

=head1 ALTERNATE INTERFACE

Instead of the sort of low-level functional interface described below,
you might like the tidier object-oriented interface now provided by
L<Text::Shoebox::Lexicon>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over

=item $lex_lol = read_sf(...options...)

Reads entries in Standard Format from the source specified.  If no
entries were read, returns false.  Otherwise, returns a reference to
the array that the entries were added to (which will be a new array,
unless the "into" option is set).

The options are:

=over

=item from_file => STRING

This specifies that the source of the SF data is a file, whose
filespec is given.

=item from_handle => FILEHANDLE

This specifies that the source of the SF data is a given filehandle.
(Examples of filehandle values: a global filehandle passed either
like C<*MYFH{IO}> or C<*MYFH>; or an object value from an IO class like
IO::Socket or IO::Handle.)

The filehandle isn't closed when all its data is read.

=item rs => STRING

This specifies that the given string should be used as the record
separator (newline string) for the data source being read from.

If the SF source is specified by a "from_file" option, and you don't
specify an "rs" option, then Text::Shoebox will try guessing the line
format of the file by reading the first 2K of the file and looking for
a CRLF ("\cm\cj"), an LF ("\cj"), or a CR ("\cm").  If you need to
stop it from trying to guess, just stipulate an "rs" value of C<$/>.

If the SF source is specified by a "from_file" option, and you don't
specify an "rs" option, then Text::Shoebox will just use the value in
the Perl variable C<$/> (the global RS value).

=item into => ARRAYREF

If this option is stipulated, then entries read will be pushed to the
end of the array specified.  Otherwise the entries will be put into a
new array.

=back

Example use:

  use Text::Shoebox;
  my $lexicon = read_sf(from_file => 'foo.sf')
   || die "No entries?";
  print scalar(@$lexicon), " entries read.\n";
  print "First entry has ",
   @{ $lexicon->[0] } / 2 , " fields.\n";

=item write_sf(...options...)

This writes the given lexicon, in Standard Format, to the destination
specified.  If all entries were written, returns true; otherwise (in
case of an IO error), returns false, in which case you should
check C<$!>.


The options are:

=over

=item from => ARRAYREF

This option must be present, to specify the lexicon that you want to
write out.

=item to_file => STRING

This specifies that the SF data is to be written to the file
specified.  (Note that the file is opened in overwrite mode, not
append mode.)

=item to_handle => FILEHANDLE

This specifies that the destination for the SF data is the given
filehandle.

The filehandle isn't closed when all the data is written to it.

=item rs => STRING

This specifies that the given string should be used as the record
separator (newline string) for the SF data written.

If not specified, defaults to "\n".

=item are_hw_keys_uniform($lol)

This function returns true iff all the entries in the lexicon have the
same key for their headword fields (i.e., the first field per record).
This will always be true if you read the lexicon from one file; but if
you read it from several, it's possible that the different files have
different keys marking headword fields.

if uniqueness is a requirement for SF lexicons that you'd want to
import into Shoebox, but some tasks you put lexicons to might require
it.

=head1 A NOTE ABOUT VALIDITY

I make very few assumptions about what characters can be in a field
key in SF files.  Just now, I happen to assume they can't start with
an underscore (lest they be considered comments), and can't contain
any whitespace characters.

I make essentially no assumptions about what can be in a field value,
except that there can be no newline followed immediately by a
backslash.  (Any newline-backslash sequence in turned into
newline-space-backslash.)

You should be aware that Shoebox, or whatever other programs use SF
files, may have a I<much> more restricted view of what can be in a
field key or value.
